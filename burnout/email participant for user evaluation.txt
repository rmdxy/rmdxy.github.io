Hi ___________! How are you?


As you may know, our research earlier provides context for developing a screen based solution for workers in social work to combat 
burnout. As a previous contributor into the research process, it would be great if you could continue to be part of the designing 
process! Our group will be developing our mid and subsequent high fidelity prototypes in a couple weeks time, and with your evaluation 
of these prototypes we can hopefully refine our design to become a great solution for reducing burnout in social workers. 

Testing should consist of two 15-25 minute sessions over the course of two weeks, so one testing session a week. 
The first session conducted during the period between the 18th of October (Friday) to the 23rd of October (Wednesday), and the
second session will be conducted during the period between the 25th of October (Friday) to the 30th of October (Wednesday).

Your interaction with the prototype can be done in a location of your own choosing, however keep in mind I will have to be present with you while you are using the prototypes!

In these sessions, you will:
1) use each prototype,
2) provide your opinion on usability, feasability and other concerns around navigating the user interface,
3) provide suggestions on the design based on your own interests

Please let me know if you are able to evaluate our prototypes! If you have any other questions please do not hesitate to contact me 
either through my email or text message (0450238818). 

Regards,
Peter
