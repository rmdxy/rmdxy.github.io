            <h2>Research Methodology</h2>
                    <p>Keeping in mind the private and confidential nature of social work, we used a 'Concurrent Triangulation of Methods' approach consisting of <b>interviews, questionnaires and online ethnographies</b> to draw as much information as possible. We narrowed our research tools to these three as other methods like contextual observation could not be performed without risking the rapport and safety of both social worker and client. </p>

            <h2>The High Priority Problems</h2>
                <p>A comparison between the main themes stemming from the primary data reveals that burnout in social work is caused by three main factors:</p>
                <div class="table">
                    <div>
                        <p><b>1. High caseload in public sector and individual client tensions</b></p>

                    <div>

                    </div>
                </div>


                <div class="h3">

                        <h3>Affinity Diagramming</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Initially, online affinity diagram tools were used to attempt and visually map these statements to cluster by apparent similarity, mimicking the physical process of writing on individual post it notes. However, due to unrealistic time constraints and the sheer number of statements, it was deemed not appropriate to use visual methods such as Miro or Trello. Subsequently, the process of affinity diagramming was initialised by going through the data, noting down different themes from each idea and colour coding similar themes. Then, through using excel spreadsheets was the data able to be sorted by similarities.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>However, through affinity diagramming and formulating insights, it was clear that the problem was much more complex than just answering the hypothesis. There were different dimensions to burnout in social work. </p>
                        <p>For example, issues with the business model in the public sector increases caseload and hence paperwork, further increasing tension with management and supervision. The medical approach of supporting diagnostics creates tension with the business approach and privatisation of social work, as private practitioners desire different work approaches but have to comply with the medical approach, leading to support that may be less efficient at solving problems, increasing stress on the private worker due to negotiating payment and writing extra paperwork for solutions that aren’t necessarily required.</p>

                        <p>Through group synthesis, we identified that these issues were large, complex issues that required not only major organisational change, but also industry-wide reforms. The problem with the majority of these problems is that they are people problems, and the core issues surrounding social work cannot be solved by simply developing an interface.</p>
                        <p>Hence, by encouraging workers to recognise, reflect, be more proactive about their burnout/stress levels before it becomes too late, we hope to create an individualised solution that reduces burnout and to use the product as a potential stepping stone for future shifts in industry perspectives. </p>

                    <p>We want the application to be designed for social workers in their working context. Therefore, the number of usability participants should not heavily outweigh utility participants, otherwise product iterations will be geared towards users that aren’t social workers and consequently fail to address the problem scenario.</p>

            <div>
                <p>By creating a user journey map based off one of our previous personas, we were able to focus on how the application may be integrated into our target user's work schedule. At this point, we put the concept on paper through the use of a flowchart. We approached making our concept real, using persona based walkthroughs to visualise the process of using our product.</p>
                <p>Following the creation of our conceptual flow chart, we created rough sketches for salient screen aspects, and linked these rough sketches back to our flowchart to create a linear wireflow.</p>

                    <p>Through our pilot test, we found that there were a multitude of issues regarding the prototype's utility and usability. as expected. The problem was that we had thought of the entire solution mentally but did not translate the concept well enough through our first prototype. This led to us rushing through the iterating process because we felt as though we had a viable solution.</p>
                    <p>Through reflection, we found that the app’s only purpose was to track breaks, but the premise of breaks are objective and numbers based - you can have the highest amount of break-time but if this time is not efficient in recognising/reducing burnout, then what’s the point?</p>

                        <p>By grouping results together, we saw a few emerging themes within our product and how different our mental model of social work was compared to our users.</p>
                        <p>For example, we made the application based on the assumption that social workers would be free to take breaks as they wish. However, conversing with our target users proved to be vital in informing changes to the app’s approach. During testing, It was stated that social workers should not reflect so much as to negatively affect their emotional wellbeing through compassion fatigue. This corroborated with our pilot test, in that users do not reflect deeply in the workplace and that “The app requires too much reflection about breaks at work.”</p>

                    <p>- We added emphasis to notifications for encouragement but through gentler suggestions and not trying to degrade their day for not taking breaks.</p>

                    <p>- We introduced a tutorial where users can understand the purpose of breaks before they start using the app.</p>

            <h1>IV. Iterative Approach</h1>
            <span class="callout">Using feedback heatmaps, we identified pain and delight points to inform prototyping phases.</span>
            <p>Due to the limited time we had with social workers, we wanted our product to improve immensely between each iteration so that we can meet the needs of social workers. We found that the best way to justify our design changes to potential stakeholders would be to visualise our changes based on the opinions of experienced social workers. Therefore, we strengthened the connection between previous feedback and our next prototype, giving us confidence that changes we make will result in a better experience for social workers.            </p>

        <h1> V. Quantitative Differences</h1>

                <h3>Timing Participants</h3>

            </div>

                    <p>For our mid fidelity prototype, we had three tasks for the user to complete. We found that taking a break took the longest due to difficulty finding the add break section and consequently focusing on other parts of the homepage before trying to add a break.</p>
                    <img src="midfideltime@2x.png" alt="midfideltime">
                    <p>Compared to our mid fidelity testing, it can be seen that our timed results under think aloud protocol has been vastly improved, even with the consideration that some context aware participants had already seen the product before.</p>

                <h3>Usability Scale</h3>

                    <p>The SUS scale was designed to extract quantitative data. This method is a reliable and valid measure of perceived usability and has become an industry standard with references in over 600 publications. From our testing, we found that out of 5 context-aware participants and 7 general usability participants, we averaged a 62.3 score for our mid-fidelity prototype, which is actually below the scale's standard.</p>
                    <img src="sus scale 1_1@2x.png" alt="sus_scale">
                    <p>Analysis of our high-fidelity SUS results back up our positive progress in increasing the usability of our product. From the graph below, there is a 21 point difference in the average usability scores compared to the mid fidelity prototype.</p>
                    <img src="sus scale 2_1@2x.png" alt="sus_scale">
                    <p>After conducting our high fidelity prototype user evaluations, we were able to see how our repeating context-aware participants scored our high fidelity iteration in comparison to our mid fidelity prototype. Hence, we can see if through our iteration process was successful in solving the problem scenario in it's context.</p>
