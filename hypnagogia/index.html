            <p>Hypnagogia is a fascinating and little-understood phenomenon that occurs during the transition from 
                wakefulness and sleep. In this experimental documentary, I had the chance to shed light upon this phenomenon,
                seeking to better understand the science and the hallucinatory state.

        <div class="text">
            <p>Traditionally, it is estimated that most of us will spend 50,000 hours
                of dreaming. Amongst this time, we are perplexed, disturbed and delighted.
                This form in our minds are still yet alineated in which many creatives have
                delved into the splirituality and conceptual approach as an art form.
            </p>
            <p> Through the eyes of a persona, the way we experience and adapt varies upon every individual. 
                As hypnagogia is experienced worldly, I wanted to create a personalised approach to indicate that we are all 
                different and that our perceptions in such a misunderstood concept will be unique to everyone. Thus,
                I decided to create a 3D soundscape visualiser, specifically highlighting:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Personal experience as a foundation: Accompanying my own data into the art.</li>
                <li>Interdisciplinary approaches: Which with the use of multiple programs I wanted to facilitate my own innovation and creative problem-solving.</li>
                <li> User empathy and engagement: A way to spark curiosity and inspire viewers to reflect on their own experiences and interpretation.</li>
                <li>Iterative refinement: Which through design thinking, it will let me prototype my approach thoroughly and allows me to adapt to new insight and ideas that surface.</li>
                <li> Potential for further research: which by illuminating the enigmatic phenomenon, I can enlighten others and push boundaries of everyoneâ€™s current knowledge.</li>
                
            </ol>
            <p>Over the semesters, practice-led research principles, literature and reflective and iterative analysis has supported my overall work and contextually
                allow me to create a refined design. ðŸ˜„
