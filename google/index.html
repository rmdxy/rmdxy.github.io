              <p>Over the 2022 summer, I had decided to build my own professional toolbox towards UX/UI.
                In order for my preparation I had decided to achieve the Google UX Design Certificate as a way to develop
                skills for the industry.

            <p>Throughout the course, I was able to develop technical and methodological skills specifically in designing
                a movie theatre application and learn how the current platforms could be improved.

            <b>The Product</b>
            <p> Featre, a mobile ticketing app for movie/cinema specifically targeting users who are looking to watch the latest big screen.</p>
            <p> This was to be completed in a 2 month accelerated course to introduce the likes of UX/UI and to develop a case study for the ongoing product.</p>
            <p>By following the layout under Google - UX Coursera, I hope to gather a more introductory understanding with UX and hope to gather a deeper research for my own benefit.</p>

            <b>The Problem</b>
            <p>The current movie theatre applications lack advanced features and fail to provide a seamless user experience, resulting in user dissatisfaction and inefficiencies in the movie ticket booking process.
                These features include:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Efficient and effective ticketing - from home to reservation </li>
                <li>Integration of review and ratings - share movie experiences</li>
                <li>Overall user interface - app design and flow</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="text">
            <b>The Goal</b>
            <p>To design an all in one movie navigation app, implementing both easy digital ticketing whilst
                implementing gamification to movie-goers.

            <b>Research Summary</b>
            <p>Keeping in mind the private and confidential nature, I used a 'Concurrent Triangulation of Methods' approach consisting of interviews, questionnaires and online
                 ethnographies to draw as much information as possible. A comparison between the midst of digital ticketing and social media is caused by three main factors:</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Platform changes</li>
                <li>Managing content and Moderation</li>
                <li>Cultural and Regional Differences</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Through the census, I was able to identified that the issues we found were large, 
                complex issues that required major functionality changes.</p>

            <p> From the low-fidelity prototype, I was given the chance to user test on 3 applicants according to the user journey.
                These applicants were able to give me feedback on the app, letting me know certain changes that could be necessary for a better experience.
            </p>
            <p> Conducting these studies I was able to identify potential issues and areas for improvement. These areas include:

            <b>Key Takeaways</b>
            <p> To summarise, the overall intuitive and simplified app, Featre, has not only met users' expectations, but also provided a delighful and hassle-free movie booking experience
                for a wide range of users. By conducting usability tests and user feedback I have realised the importance of user-centric measures
                and that quality control of a user's expectations.
            </p>
            <p>Through the course, I was able to create, Featre, an all-in-one movie application for users to access their tickets, browse through movies
                and even review them. This has allowed me to understand, design and evaluate appropriate methods in UX and UI, thus learning and preparing myself for future projects.
